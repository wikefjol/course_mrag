1. **Crete venv and install requirements.txt**  
   requirements.txt should be complete
2. **organize data**  
   - Create a directory (e.g., `sources`) with subfolders for each dataset (e.g., `lectures`, `articles`, `notes`).
   - Place your PDF, PPTX, and text files in the appropriate subfolders.
3. **access**
 For now, only the notebook has been set up and two rags have been constructed in parallel. 

TODO:
- make setup automated so we get one rag per subfolder
- start working on routing querys
- set up system prompts for the different rags
- flow of information from multiple rags -> aggergate response?
